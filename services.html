                <p>Over the paste fiew years I have picked up a lot of skills and tricks of the trade while studying at Georgian College. I have designed and developed web sites in a variety of ways. I have learned how to include dynamic, changing content to pages with languages such as Javascript as well as learning Responsive design. I have also worked with server-side programming for interaction with databases.</p>
                <p>Other than web, there has been a lot of study in desktop development as well, such as small windows forms applications, and flash animations. I have also been taught certain ways to interact with mainframes and files using languages like Cobol and JCL.</p>
       			<p>I have some experience creating arduino - projects such as a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FliFCBSWKg" alt="My Arduino Simon Says">Simon-Says</a> type game using an arduino board, buttons, LEDs and a lot of code!</p>
                <p>Following is a list of languages I have experience in:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>HTML / HTML 5</li>
                    <li>CSS / CSS3</li>
                    <li>Javascript / JQuery</li>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>ASP.NET</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                    <li>XML</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>C++ / NXC</li>
                    <li>VB</li>
                    <li>Cobol</li>
                    <li>JCL</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>With the way the web and computer industry is growing, I must stay on top of things, and my code expertese will be always expanding. I'm always excited to learn something new!</p>
